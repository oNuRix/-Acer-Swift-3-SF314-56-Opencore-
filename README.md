## Current Status

- **Fingerprint sensor** is not working (never will work)
- **Built-in DMIC** is not working (not need)
- **SdCard reader** is not working (not need)

- Everything else works well
- But battery drain too fast (battery healt was 90% on linux)
 
- Ensure to edit the **config.plist** and add valid  **PlatformInfo Generic** and **SMBIOS** values

- Install **ComboJack** to assist with Headphones / Headset
